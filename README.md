# 🩺 Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚀

This project is a **Disease Prediction System** built using **Machine Learning** and deployed as a simple **Flask web application**.  
The system takes **patient symptoms** as input and predicts the most likely disease.

## 💻 How It Works

✅ Reads symptom-disease data from CSV  
✅ Uses RandomOverSampler to handle class imbalance  
✅ Trains **five models**:
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- XGBoost

✅ Evaluates with Stratified K-Fold  
✅ Combines model predictions for better accuracy  
✅ Saves models with `joblib`  
✅ Flask Web Interface to predict diseases based on selected symptoms

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone / Download Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BALADURGAG24/disease-prediction-ml.git
cd disease-prediction-ml
```

Or download as ZIP and extract.

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare Dataset

Put your `improved_disease_dataset.csv` into the `/data` folder.

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Models

Run this command to train models and save them:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

It will:
- Train SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost  
- Save models as `.pkl` files in `/models`  
- Save the Label Encoder  
- Save symptom list  

---

## 🌐 Running the Web App

After training, launch the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open this URL in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You can select symptoms and see the predicted disease!

---

## 🧪 Command-line Prediction (Optional)

You can also test prediction in command line:

```bash
python src/predict.py
```

## Example Output (Web)

| Model                  | Prediction      |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Random Forest          | Heart Attack    |
| Naive Bayes            | UTI             |
| SVM                    | Impetigo        |
| LightGBM               | Malaria         |
| XGBoost                | Dengue          |
| **Final Combined**     | Heart Attack    |
